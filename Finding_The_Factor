# This File contains a function which accepts two numbers, number1: The number you wish to find its factors.
# number2: which position do you wish to know, for example if number1 is 30, and you insert 3 for number2, then the output
# Will be 10.
# Sorry for the poor explaination, Check My video for a better explaination of the question.
